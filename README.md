# Shell Cash Flow Datathon 2023

I am making finance analysis in Python to handle big data. In this project, I participated Shell Cash Flow Datathon 2023 on Kaggle. I came in [2'nd](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/new-shell-cashflow-datathon-2023/leaderboard) among 74 competitors on Kaggle and I present my project on the jury. I used mainly pandas,numpy, NeuralForecast,XGBRegressor,LSTM and MLForecast libraries. Enjoy learning üß≠.

## What I did do that Datathon? üîé

I predicted the Net Cash flow given from Shell Company data sets with external factors to 70 days. With this prediction, I used LSTM and Xgboost machine learning models to forecast. Before that, I cleaned a couple of columns and I estimated Platte's data sets with Xgboost. After that, I merged whole columns for the main prediction. I chose the LSTM model to give perfect results and less MAE scores for that. You can find my process model working codes in [ShellCashFlow.ipynb](https://github.com/Ybatuhan-EcoBooster/SehllCashFlowDatathon2023/blob/main/ShellCashFlow.ipynb) file.

## Streamlit Library üíª
**Streamlit:** : I made some part of my project on Streamlit. It provided many tools for achieving my project's visualization.

RUN COMMAND
---> streamlit run ShellStreamlit.py

It is opening of Local Host

## Conclusion üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

When I started Financial analysis, I discovered Python and other tools. I developed myself with open sources without any course. In this journey, I decided to improve myself in data analysis with Finance. Shell Cashflow Datathon 2023 was one of them. I joined this competition to gain experience and I came in 2'nd among 74 competitors. It is very challenging for me. But, I am happy with this score. 

I struggled to improve which ML model will be perfect for my data set prediction. When I found LSTM, I try each way to succeed. I learned many things on this journey. I will be increasing my skill with these mistakes.
